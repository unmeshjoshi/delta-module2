# DeltaTable with Atomic Writes and Transaction Log

This repo contains **Task 3** in building a Delta Lake-like storage layer. In this task, you will introduce a transaction log to manage data file consistency and implement atomic, versioned commits.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Enhance the `DeltaTable` by adding support for **atomic commits** using a **transaction log**. Each insert operation should now be tracked via structured metadata actions that are logged in a single versioned file.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation: Why Atomic Writes?

In the previous tasks, every `insert()` call wrote new Parquet files. However:

- What happens if the program crashes halfway through writing multiple files?
- How do we know which files belong to which insert?
- How do we **recover** the correct state?

To solve this, we:
- Generate **log entries** that describe what we wrote (called **Actions**).
- Store those log entries atomically in a versioned JSON file (like `00000000000000000001.json`).
- Make all file additions and deletions **explicit and versioned**.
- All the reads should only happen at a specific version of the latest snapshot
